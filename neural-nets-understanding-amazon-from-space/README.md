I built artificial intelligence algorithms to label satellite image chips with different atmospheric conditions and the different classes of land cover/land use.  For this Multi-class Multi-Label problem, some of the labels are from the following categories: Cloud Cover (clear, partly, cloudy, haze), Primary RainForest, Water (rivers, lakes), Habitation (large city, small homes), Agriculture, Roads etc. The algorithms from this project will enable us to understand where, how and why deforestation happens.

This quiz was obtained from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) Competition platform and would be submitted as a late project. 

## Steps:
1. Sign up for a Kaggle account: https://www.kaggle.com/
2. Open the Kaggle Amazon Deforestation Competition page: [Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/overview)
3. Enter the competition, read all the instructions, download the data and start with a baseline.
4. Submit your solution to Kaggle (as late submission)
TIPS: The Kaggle notebook and discussion sections are the best resources you will need for this challenge. Make use of them.

After submission, Kaggle will give you a score (Mean FScore Beta) and where you would have landed on the leadership board. Remember to share the screenshot and your Github solution notebook.

## Description

Every minute, the world loses an area of forest the size of 48 football fields. And deforestation in the Amazon Basin accounts for the largest share, contributing to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change, and other devastating effects. But better data about the location of deforestation and human encroachment on forests can help governments and local stakeholders respond more quickly and effectively.

Planet, designer and builder of the world’s largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites, will soon be collecting daily imagery of the entire land surface of the earth at 3-5 meter resolution. While considerable research has been devoted to tracking changes in forests, it typically depends on coarse-resolution imagery from Landsat (30 meter pixels) or MODIS (250 meter pixels). This limits its effectiveness in areas where small-scale deforestation or forest degradation dominate.

Furthermore, these existing methods generally cannot differentiate between human causes of forest loss and natural causes. Higher resolution imagery has already been shown to be exceptionally good at this, but robust methods have not yet been developed for Planet imagery.

In this competition, Planet and its Brazilian partner SCCON are challenging Kagglers to label satellite image chips with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use. Resulting algorithms will help the global community better understand where, how, and why deforestation happens all over the world - and ultimately how to respond.

## Methodology
1. Review the data page, which includes detailed information about the labels and the labeling process.
2. Download a subsample of the data to get familiar with how it looks.
3. Explore the subsample on Kernels. We’ve created a notebook for you to get started.
